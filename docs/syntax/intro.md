# Syntax (Skladba)

Syntax deals with how words are combined to form sentences.

## Basic Structure
The standard word order in Czech is **SVO** (Subject - Verb - Object), just like in English.
*   *Petr má auto.* (Peter has a car.)

However, because Czech uses **cases** to show the role of each word, the word order is much more **flexible**.
*   *Auto má Petr.* (It is Peter who has the car.)
*   *Petr auto má.* (Peter *does* have the car.)

## Subject-Verb Agreement
The verb must agree with the subject in **Person** and **Number**. In the Past Tense, it must also agree in **Gender**.

*   *Muž spal.* (The man slept.)
*   *Žena spala.* (The woman slept.)
*   *Dítě spalo.* (The child slept.)
