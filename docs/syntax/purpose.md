# Purpose Clauses (Účelové věty)

Purpose clauses express **why** someone does something ("in order to", "so that"). They are introduced by **aby**.

## 1. Same Subject (Infinitive)
If the subject of the main clause and the purpose clause is the same, Czechs often use **aby** + Past Tense (l-participle), but strictly speaking, you can sometimes use just the infinitive if it's a motion verb.

However, the standard "Aby" construction is:
*   *Jdu do obchodu, **abych koupil** chleba.* (I go to the shop [so that I would] buy bread.)
    *   *Aby* conjugates exactly like *Kdyby*!

### Conjugation of Aby

| Person | Form |
| :--- | :--- |
| Já | **abych** |
| Ty | **abys** |
| On | **aby** |
| My | **abychom** |
| Vy | **abyste** |
| Oni | **aby** |

## 2. Different Subjects
If I want YOU to do something.
*   *Chci, **abys** to udělal.* (I want you to do it. - Lit: "I want so that you did it.")
*   *Řekl jsem mu, **aby** odešel.* (I told him to leave.)

*Note: This is how Czech expresses "I want you to..." (Chci, abys...). You cannot say "Chci tě dělat".*
