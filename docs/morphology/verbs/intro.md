# Verbs (Slovesa)

Czech verbs conjugate (*časují se*) to indicate:
1.  **Person** (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
2.  **Number** (Singular, Plural)
3.  **Tense** (Present, Past, Future)
4.  **Mood** (Indicative, Imperative, Conditional)
5.  **Voice** (Active, Passive)
6.  **Aspect** (Perfective, Imperfective)

## The Infinitive
The basic form of the verb found in dictionaries. It almost always ends in **-t** (archaic *-ti*).
*   *dělat* (to do/make)
*   *být* (to be)
*   *jít* (to go)

## Subject Pronouns
In Czech, subject pronouns are usually **omitted** because the verb ending makes it clear who is speaking.
*   *(Já)* **jsem** Petr. (I am Peter.)
*   *(Ty)* **děláš** úkol. (You are doing homework.)

They are used only for emphasis or contrast.
