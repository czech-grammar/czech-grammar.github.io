# Morphology (Tvarosloví)

Morphology is the study of word forms. Czech is a highly inflected language, meaning words change their form based on their grammatical function.

## What You'll Learn

### Nouns (Podstatná jména)
- **Gender**: Masculine, Feminine, Neuter
- **Number**: Singular, Plural
- **Cases**: All 7 Czech cases with full declension tables

### Adjectives (Přídavná jména)
- Hard vs Soft declension patterns
- Agreement with nouns
- Comparison (comparative, superlative)

### Pronouns (Zájmena)
- Personal, Possessive, Demonstrative
- Interrogative and Relative pronouns
- Short vs Long forms

### Verbs (Slovesa)
- Conjugation classes
- Tenses: Present, Past, Future
- Aspect: Perfective vs Imperfective
- Moods: Imperative, Conditional

### Other Topics
- **Numerals**: Cardinal and ordinal numbers
- **Adverbs**: Formation and comparison

## Why Morphology Matters

Understanding morphology is essential for Czech because:
1. Word endings convey grammatical meaning (no word order rules like English)
2. Adjectives must agree with nouns in gender, number, and case
3. Verb endings tell you who is doing the action
4. Prepositions require specific cases

Start with the **Nouns** section to learn the case system, then explore other word classes!
