# Personal Pronouns (Osobní zájmena)

Personal pronouns decline just like nouns. They are often the hardest part of Czech morphology because they have **short (clitic)** and **long (emphatic)** forms.

## Basic Forms (Nominative)

| Person | Singular | Plural |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1st | **Já** (I) | **My** (We) |
| 2nd | **Ty** (You) | **Vy** (You - plural/formal) |
| 3rd | **On** (He), **Ona** (She), **To** (It) | **Oni** (They - Ma), **Ony** (They - F/Mi), **Ona** (They - N) |

## Short vs. Long Forms
In Genitive, Dative, and Accusative, some pronouns have two forms.
1.  **Short (Weak)**: Used in normal sentences, placed in the "second position" (Wackernagel's position). Cannot start a sentence.
2.  **Long (Strong)**: Used after prepositions or for emphasis. Can start a sentence.

### Example: "Me" (Accusative/Genitive)
*   Short: **mě**
*   Long: **mne** (archaic/formal) or **mě** (standard) - *Wait, they are often the same now!*
*   Let's look at **Ty** (You):
    *   Short: **tě** (*Vidím tě.* - I see you.)
    *   Long: **tebe** (*Vidím tebe, ne jeho.* - I see YOU, not him. / *Pro tebe.* - For you.)

### The "Him" Table (On)

| Case | Short | Long (Emphasis) | After Preposition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Gen | **ho** | **jeho** | **něho** |
| Dat | **mu** | **jemu** | **němu** |
| Acc | **ho** | **jeho** | **něho** |

*Note: After a preposition, "j" becomes "n" (jeho -> něho).*
