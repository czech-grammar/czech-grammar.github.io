# Nouns (Podstatná jména)

Nouns in Czech are complex because they change their form (inflect) based on their role in the sentence. This process is called **declension** (*skloňování*).

To correctly use a noun, you need to know three things about it:

1.  **Gender** (*Rod*): Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter.
2.  **Number** (*Číslo*): Singular or Plural.
3.  **Case** (*Pád*): The grammatical function (subject, object, etc.).

## The 14 Forms
Because there are 7 cases and 2 numbers (singular/plural), theoretically, every noun has **14 different forms**. In practice, some forms are identical, but the variety is still significant compared to English.

*   *Dům* (house - subject)
*   *Bez domu* (without a house)
*   *K domu* (to a house)
*   *Vidím dům* (I see a house)
*   *O domě* (about a house)
*   *S domem* (with a house)

Don't panic! There are patterns (models) that make this manageable.
