# Vowels (Samohlásky)

Czech vowels are clear and distinct. They are never reduced to a "schwa" sound (like the *a* in English *about*) regardless of stress.

## Short and Long Vowels

Every vowel in Czech has a short and a long version. The length is indicated by a diacritic mark called **čárka** (acute accent) or **kroužek** (ring).

| Short | Long | Pronunciation Note |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **a** | **á** | Like *a* in *father*, but longer. |
| **e** | **é** | Like *ai* in *air*. |
| **i / y** | **í / ý** | Like *ee* in *feet*. |
| **o** | **ó** | Like *aw* in *law*. |
| **u** | **ú / ů** | Like *oo* in *moon*. |

### The Importance of Length
Vowel length can change the meaning of a word completely.

*   *dal* (he gave) vs. *dál* (further)
*   *pas* (passport/waist) vs. *pás* (belt)
*   *byt* (apartment) vs. *být* (to be)

## The Two "U"s: Ú vs. Ů

You will notice there are two ways to write long *u*: **ú** and **ů**. They are pronounced exactly the same.

1.  **Ú (with čárka)**: Used at the **beginning** of words.
    *   *úkol* (task), *únor* (February), *úspěch* (success).
2.  **Ů (with kroužek)**: Used in the **middle or end** of words.
    *   *dům* (house), *stůl* (table), *dolů* (down).

*Exception: Compound words (trojúhelník - triangle) and some loanwords (skútr - scooter).*

## The Y/I Mystery

Czech has two letters for the "i" sound: **i (soft i)** and **y (hard y)**.
*   **Pronunciation**: In modern standard Czech, they are pronounced **identically**.
*   **Function**: They indicate the "hardness" or "softness" of the *preceding* consonant.
    *   **di, ti, ni**: Pronounced softly as *ďi, ťi, ňi*.
    *   **dy, ty, ny**: Pronounced hard, exactly as written.

## Diphthongs (Dvojhlásky)

A diphthong is a combination of two vowels in a single syllable.

*   **ou**: Pronounced like *ow* in *low* (but not *cow*). Very common.
    *   *mouka* (flour), *louka* (meadow).
*   **au**: Pronounced like *ow* in *cow*. Mostly in loanwords and interjections.
    *   *auto* (car), *au!* (ouch!).
*   **eu**: Pronounced as *e* + *u*. Mostly in loanwords.
    *   *euro*, *pneumatika*.
