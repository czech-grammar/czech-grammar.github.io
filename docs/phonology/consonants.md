# Consonants (Souhlásky)

Czech consonants are categorized into three groups: **Hard**, **Soft**, and **Neutral**. This classification is crucial for grammar, as it determines which vowels can follow them and how words decline.

## Classification

### 1. Hard Consonants (Tvrdé)
These are usually followed by **y** (hard y), never *i* (except in loanwords).

> **H, Ch, K, R, D, T, N**

*   *hy, chy, ky, ry, dy, ty, ny*

### 2. Soft Consonants (Měkké)
These are usually followed by **i** (soft i), never *y*.

> **Ž, Š, Č, Ř, C, J, Ď, Ť, Ň**

*   *ži, ši, či, ři, ci, ji, di, ti, ni*

### 3. Neutral Consonants (Obojetné)
These can be followed by either **i** or **y**.

> **B, F, L, M, P, S, V, Z**

*   To know whether to write *i* or *y* after these, Czech children learn "Enumerated Words" (*vyjmenovaná slova*) - lists of roots where *y* is written. In other cases, it's usually *i*.

## The Letter Ř

The letter **Ř** is unique to Czech and often feared by learners. It is a trilled *r* combined with a fricative sound (like *zh* or *sh*).

*   **Voiced Ř**: Sounds like a trilled *r* + *zh* (as in *plea**s**ure*). Used before voiced consonants or vowels.
    *   *řeka* (river), *dřevo* (wood).
*   **Voiceless Ř**: Sounds like a trilled *r* + *sh* (as in *sh**ip*). Used at the end of words or near voiceless consonants.
    *   *tři* (three), *pekař* (baker).

### How to pronounce it?
Start by saying "t-sh" (*tři* sounds a bit like *tree* but with a hiss). Try whispering "R" and "Zh" simultaneously. It takes practice!

## Ď, Ť, Ň

These are "soft" versions of D, T, N.
*   **Written with háček**: *ď, ť, ň* (lowercase) or *Ď, Ť, Ň* (uppercase).
*   **Written with 'i'**: When followed by *i* or *í*, the hook is omitted, but the sound remains soft.
    *   *dě, tě, ně* = *ďe, ťe, ňe*
    *   *di, ti, ni* = *ďi, ťi, ňi*
