# Introduction to Czech Phonology

Czech (*čeština*) is a West Slavic language known for its rich system of consonants and vowels. For learners, Czech phonology presents both challenges and simplifications compared to English.

## Key Characteristics

1.  **Phonetic Consistency**: Czech is largely a "read-as-you-write" language. Once you learn the rules, you can pronounce almost any word correctly just by reading it.
2.  **Fixed Stress**: The stress (accent) is almost always on the **first syllable** of the word.
3.  **Vowel Length**: Vowels can be short or long. Length is distinctive, meaning it can change the meaning of a word (e.g., *byt* = apartment vs. *být* = to be).
4.  **Consonant Clusters**: Czech is famous for allowing long sequences of consonants without vowels (e.g., *zmrzlina* - ice cream, *čtvrtek* - Thursday).
5.  **The Letter Ř**: A unique sound specific to Czech, often considered one of the most difficult sounds for foreigners to master.

## Diacritics

Czech uses three main diacritical marks:

*   **Čárka (´)**: Indicates a **long vowel** (e.g., *á, é, í, ó, ú, ý*). It does *not* indicate stress.
*   **Háček (ˇ)**: Indicates **softening** (palatalization) of a consonant (e.g., *č, š, ž, ř, ň, ť, ď*) or the vowel *e* (*ě*).
*   **Kroužek (˚)**: Used only over *u* (*ů*) to indicate a long *u* sound that evolved historically.

In the following sections, we will explore the alphabet, vowels, consonants, and rules of stress in detail.
