# Pronunciation Rules

Czech pronunciation is consistent, but it requires attention to detail, especially regarding vowel length and specific consonant sounds.

## The "Write As You Hear" Principle

Unlike English or French, Czech is largely phonetic. If you see a letter, you pronounce it. There are very few silent letters.

*   **Example**: *knedlík* (dumpling) is pronounced with the *k* audible: /knɛdliːk/.

## Voicing Assimilation

One of the most important rules in fluent Czech speech is **voicing assimilation**. When voiced and voiceless consonants meet, they often influence each other.

### The Rule
The **last consonant** in a group determines the voicing for the whole group.

*   **Voiced + Voiceless → Voiceless**
    *   *tužka* (pencil) → pronounced as *tuška* (ž becomes š because k is voiceless)
    *   *včera* (yesterday) → pronounced as *fčera* (v becomes f because č is voiceless)

*   **Voiceless + Voiced → Voiced**
    *   *kde* (where) → pronounced as *gde* (k becomes g because d is voiced)
    *   *prosba* (request) → pronounced as *prozba* (s becomes z because b is voiced)

### Final Devoicing
At the end of a word, voiced consonants are pronounced as their voiceless counterparts.

*   *led* (ice) → pronounced as *let*
*   *dub* (oak) → pronounced as *dup*
*   *lev* (lion) → pronounced as *lef*

### Voiced and Voiceless Pairs

| Voiced | B | D | Ď | G | H | V | Z | Ž |
| :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **Voiceless** | **P** | **T** | **Ť** | **K** | **Ch** | **F** | **S** | **Š** |

*Note: **V** is unique. It causes assimilation when it follows a voiceless consonant (*tvůj* -> *tfůj* is wrong, *květ* -> *květ*), but it does **not** cause a preceding voiceless consonant to become voiced (*svět* is *svět*, not *zvět*).*

## The Glottal Stop (Ráz)

In Czech, words beginning with a vowel are often preceded by a "glottal stop" (a slight catch in the throat, like in the English "uh-oh"). This is especially true after prepositions.

*   *v okně* (in the window) → pronounced as *v 'okně* (the *v* does not link to the *o*, it stays separate).
*   *z Ameriky* (from America) → pronounced as *s 'Ameriky* (z becomes s due to the unvoiced glottal stop).
