# Stress (Přízvuk)

Stress in Czech is very regular, which makes it easier to learn than languages like English or Russian where stress is unpredictable.

## The Golden Rule

> In Czech, the main stress is always on the **first syllable** of the word.

*   ***Prah**a* (PRA-ha)
*   ***re**publika* (RE-pub-li-ka)
*   ***ne**rozumím* (NE-ro-zu-mím)

## Prepositions

Monosyllabic prepositions (prepositions with one syllable) often "steal" the stress from the following noun. They form a single phonetic unit with the noun.

*   *na stole* (on the table) → pronounced as ***na**stole*
*   *do Prahy* (to Prague) → pronounced as ***do**prahy*
*   *ve škole* (in school) → pronounced as ***ve**škole*

This creates a distinctive rhythm in spoken Czech.

## Secondary Stress

In very long words, there may be a secondary stress on the third or fifth syllable, but it is much weaker than the primary stress on the first syllable. It is not critical for being understood.

*   ***ne**jneobhospo**da**řovávanějšími* (the most uncultivatable ones) - *a famous long word example!*

## Vowel Length vs. Stress

It is crucial to distinguish between **stress** (loudness/emphasis) and **length** (duration).
*   In English, stressed syllables are often longer.
*   In Czech, they are independent. A syllable can be unstressed but long.

**Example**: *babička* (grandmother)
*   Stress: 1st syllable (**ba**)
*   Length: All short.
*   Pronunciation: **BA**-bich-ka

**Example**: *prodává* (he sells)
*   Stress: 1st syllable (**pro**)
*   Length: 2nd and 3rd syllables are long (**dá**, **vá**).
*   Pronunciation: **PRO**-daa-vaa
